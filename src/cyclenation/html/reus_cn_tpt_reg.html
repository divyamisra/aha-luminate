<p><strong>CYCLENATION&trade; PARTICIPATION RELEASE AND PRIVACY CONSENT</strong><br>
  YOU MUST BE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OF AGE TO PARTICIPATE IN CYCLENATION&trade;.  </p>
   <p>
    CycleNation&trade; involves riding bicycles and increased physical exertion, which may include risks such as increased heart rate, muscle pain and strain, increased body temperature, falls, and interaction with other participants or equipment. Because this type of physical exercise can be strenuous and subject me to risks, I represent and warrant that I will consult with a physician before participation in the event to confirm that I am physically capable of participating in the event. In consideration of being allowed to participate in this event, I hereby expressly assume all risks, including personal injury and death, arising in any way out of my participation in the CycleNation&trade; event and related activities.<br><br>
  It is my responsibility to dress appropriately. Although bikes, water, and other assistance may be made available during this event, I am solely responsible for my own health and safety. I represent and warrant that I will not participate in a CycleNation&trade; event if I am not physically fit or do not feel able to participate, and I agree to stop and request assistance if I experience any symptoms such as dizziness, excessive fatigue, shortness of breath, pain, falls, muscle strain, weakness, or any other conditions that would make it difficult or unsafe to continue.<br><br>
  I agree, for myself, my heirs, executors, and administrators, to not sue, and to release, indemnify, and hold harmless, the American Heart Association, Inc. ("AHA"), its affiliates, offices, directors, volunteers, and employees, and all sponsoring businesses and organizations and their agents and employees, from any and all liability, claims, demands and causes of action whatsoever, arising out of my participation in this event and related activities - whether it results from the negligence of any of the above or from any other cause.<br><br>
  This release and indemnification agreement is as broad and inclusive as permitted by the state or province in which the event is conducted. If any portion of it is invalid, the balance will continue in full force and effect.<br><br>
  In addition to the above release and indemnification, I authorize the use, copyright, or publication of my name, image, or voice from participating in this event and in any related activities. I agree that AHA may use and share personal information given by me from this event, from personal information given to AHA previously, and from personal information that AHA may have collected through its websites, apps, social media sites, and devices, including information about me that AHA combines with that collected by others, whether captured by photograph or recording in any medium for any purpose, including illustration, promotion or advertisement, in any format whatsoever. I acknowledge that AHA may collect various types of personal information, including health, financial, location, and information from social media accounts, contacts databases, and devices.<br><br>
  AHA uses and shares personal information to fulfill AHA's mission to build healthier lives free from heart disease and stroke, to give opportunities to donate, to offer or provide products and services, and to improve programs and websites. For example, if I sign petitions, join groups, or otherwise attach my personal information to an AHA initiative, I agree that such information may be displayed on AHA's website or otherwise be made publicly available. AHA will use, share, and protect my information as required by law.<br><br>
