            <p>No question about it. Staying pumped to keep raising funds over months and weeks takes discipline. All the same, your team and all of us at CycleNation are counting on you. That's why we're asking all participants to take a pledge to raise a minimum amount for the American Heart Association | American Stroke Association. And to make it stick, we're asking for an upfront "good faith" fee.</p>
            <p><strong>Here's how it works.</strong>&nbsp;To complete the registration process, you'll be required to use your credit card to pay a non-refundable self-pledge ($5 for Virtual Riders; $50 for physical Riders). This self-pledge gets credited to your fundraising minimum. The credit card number you provide to pay your self-pledge will be held securely on file and charged again ONLY if you are unable to meet the minimum by the fundraising cut-off date of 6/28/2019.</p>
            <p><strong>Since the fundraising cut-off date ends after the Ride event, most participants will have had ample time to meet their minimum and then some.</strong> That's why the sooner you register and start recruiting/raising funds, the more time you'll have to reach your minimums. Then you're home free and off the hook</p>
